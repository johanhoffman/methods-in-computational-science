So the goal is to write the martix $A$ as the product of multiple matrices, which makes it easier to calculate the solution. The mandatory tasks are the implementation of the sparse matrix-vector product, the QR factorization of a given matrix and the direct solving of system $Ax=b$. From the extra tasks, I chose to implement the QR eigenvalue algorithm."
